        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Yoga, a profound spiritual and physical discipline, traces its roots to ancient India over 5,000 years ago. 
          The term "yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit word "yuj," meaning "to unite" or "to join," symbolizing the 
          union of body, mind, and spirit.
